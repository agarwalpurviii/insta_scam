# **App Name**: ScamWatch

## Core Features:

- Seller ID Search: Search for Instagram seller IDs to check if they are listed as potential scammers.
- Scam Report Submission: Allow users to submit detailed reports of scam activity with supporting evidence like screenshots and transaction records.
- Directory of Scam Accounts: Browse a searchable directory of Instagram accounts identified as scams.
- User Testimonials and Scam Details: View testimonials and detailed scam reports submitted by other users, providing insights into scam tactics.
- AI-Powered Scam Pattern Recognition: Employ an AI tool to analyze submitted reports and identify patterns indicative of scam operations. This would not involve any storage of past inputs; it would simply inform the app that it might be a scam.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) for a serious and secure feel.
- Primary color: Alert red (#FF4136) for highlighting scam warnings and critical information. The choice of a vibrant, saturated red grabs user attention, signalling caution without directly resembling money (as an analogous green might).
- Accent color: A slightly lighter, desaturated red (#D9534F) used sparingly for interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text, offering a modern and objective appearance.
- Use warning symbols and alert icons in red to denote scam accounts or potential risks.
- Emphasize negative space to enhance readability and draw attention to crucial scam-related data.
- Subtle animations can be used to highlight important information.
